# Skype History Statistics

Collect Skype history statistics from an exported Skype log generated by Skyperious.

## Get Started

1. Download or clone the source
2. Put the logs in the `data` folder inside the project directory.
3. Build the solution.

You can find the built `exe` file in `C:\Users\AGEISZL\Desktop\Projects\SkypeHistoryStats\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.0`.

## Usage
Run the `exe` file with the data folder next to it. Alternatively, you can also pass the history logfiles' names as arguments.
